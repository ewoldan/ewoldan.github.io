# Hi there, I'm Emilia! ðŸ‘‹

## About Me

Iâ€™m someone who loves solving problems and making things run smoother. Iâ€™ve worked across program management, business analytics, and systems design, bringing structure to projects and clarity through data. Iâ€™m all about making sure business and tech actually speak the same language. I thrive on the challenge of bringing order to chaos, whether thatâ€™s in data, systems, or projects.

## Key Projects

- **[British Airways Customer Reviews & Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/ewoldan/Web-Scraping-for-Customer-Sentiment.git)**  
  *Developed a web scraping pipeline using BeautifulSoup to extract customer reviews for British Airways. Cleaned and processed the data with Pandas, stored it in a relational database, and created an interactive Tableau dashboard to visualize customer sentiment, trends, and service insights. This project showcases skills in data collection, cleaning, database management, and visualization.*
